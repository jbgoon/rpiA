# MCB 124 Maxiproject

## What is this project?

This project is an in-depth analysis of Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, a nearly-universal enzyme. 

## How is this project organized?

- '/E_coli' contains the sequence and crystallographic information for the protein in E. coli, which is the reference organism.
- '/Assignments' contains the canvas-submitted written assignments for the project.
- '/MSA' contains multi-sequence alignments, which are analyzed in assignment 2.
	- 'PF06026_seed' is a pfam alignment
	-
- '/FASTA' contains fasta files for E. coli and 5 other organisms with sequence identity < 50%. See assignment 2.
